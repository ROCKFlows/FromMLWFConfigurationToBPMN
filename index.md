## Overview

The **ml2wf** project aims at helping **Data Scientists** to create their workflows in the BPMN standard from a FeatureModel and to capitalize on their knowledge from new BPMN workflows.

You can define your own **constraints** easily by commenting your workflow using a predefined and customizable syntax.

Once created and modified, the data scientist can merge the workflow into the FeatureModel and **reuse** it later.

Furthermore, it will allow data scientists to reduce **meta-learning** space and, over time, **automate** the creation of workflows tailored to a given time series anomaly detection problem.

## Usage

#### Command line

##### NAME

<pre>
ml2wf  Machine Learning problem to Workflow
</pre>

ml2wf save -i <ins>meta</ins> <ins>instance</ins> -o <ins>FeatureModel</ins> [-b] [-v level]</pre>

##### DESCRIPTION

###### Commands

<pre>generate  generate a workflow
build     build a FeatureModel from a set of workflows
merge     import a worklow in a FeatureModel
save      save a meta-workflow and its instance in a FeatureModel</pre>

###### Arguments

<pre>-i, --input       input path
-o, --output      output path
-b, --backup      backup the original FeatureModel file before any modification
-f, --full		  process a full merge (including meta/instance relationship)
-v, --verbose     verbose mode (0=OFF,1=FATAL,2=ERROR,3=WARN,4=INFO,5=DEBUG,6=TRACE,7=ALL)</pre>


#### Configuration

The default configuration is the following :

```
# constraints syntax (name : arity : symbol)

before : 2 : >>
after : 2 : <<

imp : 2 : =>
equ : 2 : <=>

conj : 2 : &
disj : 2 : |

not : 1 : !
```

**Note** that you can change this configuration modifying the `configuration.cfg` under the `ml2wf/config` directory

## Installation

#### Prerequisites

[JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

#### Build

```bash
cd ml2wf
mvn clean package
```

The generated `.jar` is located in the `target` directory.

#### Run

```bash
cd target
java -jar ml2wf.jar [command] [arguments]
```


## Example

Lets consider this generic workflow : **my_wf.bpmn2** :

![generical_wf](./img/generical_wf.png)

and this initial feature model : **featureModel.xml** :

![initial_fm](./img/initial_fm.png)

#### Step 1 : Instantiation & Modification

We instantiate our generic workflow using the **generate** command :

```bash
java -jar ml2wf.jar generate -i my_wf.bpmn2 -o result/
```

> *Note that the resulting instance will be located in the `result` directory with the name `my_wf_instance.bpmn2`.*

We change the tasks names which give us :

![instantiated_wf](./img/instantiated_wf.png)

> *Note that we put some constraints on our tasks (in comments).*

**=> We now have 3 possibilities to create our knowledge database (*FeatureModel*).**

#### Step 2-A : Merging

We can merge our workflows in the *FeatureModel* using the **merge** command :

```bash
java -jar ml2wf.jar merge --meta -f -i my_wf.bpmn2 -o featureModel.xml
java -jar ml2wf.jar merge --instance -f -i result/my_wf_instance.bpmn2 -o featureModel.xml
```

> *Note that the -f argument will merge the meta/instance relationship*

> *Beware a merge-instance only works properly if you use a generated workflow.
Indeed in the XML (and not directly visible) _<bpmn2:property id="Property_1" name="instance"/></bpmn2:task>_ gives information about the fact that the task must be considered as an instance, which will transform it into a concrete Feature. You can see the properties of a task by double-clicking on it.*



#### Step 2-B : Saving

We can save the meta and instance relationship in the *FeatureModel* using the **save** command :

```bash
java -jar ml2wf.jar save -i my_wf.bpmn2 result/my_wf_instance -o featureModel.xml
```

> *Note that like any other command, unless the --backup (-b) argument is specified, the original FeatureModel will be modified without backing it up.*

#### Step 2-C : Building

We can build the *FeatureModel* using our existing workflows and the **build **command :

```bash
java -jar ml2wf.jar build -f featureModel.xml -m my_wf.bpmn2 -i result/
```

> *Note that the -m/-i argument can be a directory. In that case, all workflows in the given directory will be merged in the FeatureModel*.

**=> Here is the result :**

![result_feature_model](img/result_fm.png)

> *Note that the workflows' constraints are translated into FeatureModel constraints in order to keep our knowledge database consistency.*

#### Step 3  : Reusing your generated tasks for other workflows

Using the [*FeatureIDE*](https://featureide.github.io/), you now can select the wished tasks and it will automatically select the needed ones.
